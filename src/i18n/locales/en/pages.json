      "title": "The frustration that drove us",
      "intro": "Each of us experienced the consequences of this knowledge loss from a different perspective:",
      "elina": "For Elina, it was the weekly nightmare of manually updating Salesforce after every customer conversation, just to keep other teams informed. Critical insights were lost when this manual process became a bottleneck.",
      "ehsan": "For Ehsan, it was the constant struggle to translate the essence of stakeholder meetings into concrete, deliverable features. Too often, the true needs and the \"why\" behind decisions remained hidden.",
      "juan": "For Juan, it was the realization of how often technical knowledge remained trapped in silos and had to be explained again and again in subsequent meetings, slowing down development.",
      "conclusion": "We realized: The most valuable capital of a company – the implicit knowledge, the justifications for decisions and the strategic context – evaporates the moment a meeting ends. Companies thereby lose not only time, but above all their collective intelligence."
